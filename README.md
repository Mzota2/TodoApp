## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Material UI
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This project has helped me to understand and implement theme modes of a web application. The app has two modes, light and dark theme. I have also learnt how to work with useContext Hook in ReactJS.



### Continued development

I would like to learn more about Material UI and make it my first choice CSS library in my future projects.
